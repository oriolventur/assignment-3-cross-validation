# Assignment 3 - Cross-Validation and Grid Search

This repository contains the third assignment for the Artificial Intelligence 1 course during my Business Analytics master's program.

## 📊 Objective

- Generate a synthetic dataset using a spiral pattern (`make_spirals`).
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Implement 5-fold stratified cross-validation to assess model performance.
- Perform grid search for hyperparameter tuning (gamma parameter in SVM).
- Visualize model decision boundaries and performance metrics.

## 📁 Contents

- `A3_Grid Search.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the complete workflow for cross-validation and grid search.

## ⚙️ Technologies

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- plotly

## 🚀 How to Run

Open `A3_Grid Search.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode and execute the cells in order.
